# DNCNN_Gaussian_denoising
Gaussian denoising on noisy images using the DNCNN technique
# Motivation
To clean the noisy images using Residual Neural Networks. The model proposed end-to-end trainable deep CNN for
Gaussian denoising. In contrast to the existing deep neural network-based methods which directly estimates the latent clean image, this network adopts the residual learning strategy to remove the latent clean image from noisy observation.
